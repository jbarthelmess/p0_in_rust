Project 0 Bank API

Your project 0 is to create a RESTful API for a bank.
This bank has two main resources. clients and accounts

the API needs to support the following endpoints

	POST /clients => Creates a new client
		return a 201 status code
	
	GET /clients => gets all clients
		return 200

	GET /clients/10 => get client with id of 10
		return 404 if no such client exist

	PUT /clients/12 => updates client with id of 12	
		return 404 if no such client exist

	DELETE /clients/15 => deletes client with the id of15
		return 404 if no such client exist
	

	POST /clients/5/accounts =>creates a new account for client with the id of 5
		return a 201 status code

	GET /clients/7/accounts => get all accounts for client 7
		return 404 if no client exists

	GET /clients/7/accounts?amountLessThan=2000&amountGreaterThan400 => get all accounts for client 7 between 400 and 2000
		return 404 if no client exists

	GET /clients/9/accounts/4 => get account 4 for client 9
		return 404 if no account or client exists

	PUT /clients/10/accounts/3 => update account  with the id 3 for client 10
		return 404 if no account or client exists

	DELETE /clients/15/accounts/6 => delete account 6 for client 15
		return 404 if no account or client exists

Technical requirements:
	All DAO and Service methods must have a test proving that they work
	All endpoints must have a Postman test verifying functionality
